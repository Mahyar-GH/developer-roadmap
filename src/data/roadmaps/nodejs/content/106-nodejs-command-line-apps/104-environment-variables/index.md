# Environment variables

Environment variables in Node.js are key-value pairs used to configure applications based on their runtime environment. Accessed via `process.env`, they enable developers to manage settings, handle sensitive data securely, and adapt application behavior across various deployment environments such as development, testing, and production. Tools like `dotenv` simplify loading environment variables from a `.env` file, enhancing configuration management in Node.js applications.
